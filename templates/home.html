    <h2>About me</h2>
    
    <p>👋 Hello, I'm Prathamesh Sonar! I'm an ETC engineer with an honors degree in data science. Passionate about leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights, I specialize in data analytics. <br>💡 My goal is to utilize my skills to drive data-driven decision making and solve complex problems.

    <br>⚙️ In addition to my technical expertise, I'm also a sports enthusiast, currently serving as the vice captain of my cricket team. <br>🏏 I believe that teamwork and perseverance are vital both on and off the field.

      <br>🌟 When I'm not diving into data or playing cricket, you can find me exploring the world of anime and learning the beautiful Japanese language. 🎌 I'm fascinated by the rich storytelling and cultural aspects that anime offers.

      <br>💻 Open to exciting opportunities in the field of data analytics, I'm eager to collaborate, learn, and contribute to innovative projects. Let's connect and create data-driven solutions together! 🤝</p>
